        Hi buddy! My name is Raghav and today we are going to talk a little bit about programming. So programming is a process of creating a set of instuctions written in computer language
        that the computer executes. We use programming languages to do programming. Example Python, C++, Javascript and many more. In programming we  write high level language which we can
        understand and there is a compiler which high level language to low level language which computer can understand 0 and 1 . Through programming we can make apps, websites and games. I am also learning coding since
        last one and a half year. In the starting I was learning blockly language where I was using blocks. From June I started learning javascript and i will learn more. Thankyou
     </p>

            console.log(first_name);
            var second_name="Guy";
            console.log(second_name);
            var full_name=first_name.concat(last_name);
            console.log(full_name);
            var a="15";
            console.log(a);
            var b="5";
            console.log(b);
            var answer=a*b;
            console.log(answer);
